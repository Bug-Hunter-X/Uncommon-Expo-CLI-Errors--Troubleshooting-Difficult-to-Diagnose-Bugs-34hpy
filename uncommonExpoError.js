This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to manage an Expo project.  The project might be configured incorrectly, causing unexpected behavior during the build or start process. It can manifest as a generic error message or crash without clear indication of the root cause. Often, this is due to conflicting dependencies, incorrect configurations in `app.json` or `package.json`, or issues with the project's underlying Node.js environment.
